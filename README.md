This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server becomes unresponsive when handling long-running requests without proper asynchronous handling. The `bug.js` file shows a server that introduces a 5-second delay in responding, potentially causing issues with client-side timeouts or perceived unresponsiveness.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to handle this using asynchronous operations and event listeners.
